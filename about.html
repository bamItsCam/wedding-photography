            <h3>Our Mission</h3>
            <p>We believe that a photographer's skill should be what matters, not the size of his or her network.</p><p>We believe that couples shouldn't feel the need to overpay for a photographer simply because they want a name that they can trust.</p><p>We believe there is untapped skill in the wedding photography world and a high demand for it: we aim to bring the two together.</p>

            <h3>How We Do It</h3>
            <p>Essentially, we pair wedding photographers we know and trust with couples looking for a photographer for their special day. Those applying to be a WU approved photographer first go through a rigorous application and screening process, including portfolio reviews and an in-person interview process. From there, we add a select few to our network, and begin matching couples with photographers based on availability, pricing, and experience.</p>
